Create a realistic body camera system for R15 character models, where the camera view is initially blurred and gradually clears as the player spawns.

The camera should start with a blurred effect, simulating the player's vision adjusting to the environment, and then slowly transition to a clear view, revealing the player's character model.

Implement a camera shake effect that mimics real-life camera movement, taking into account the player's movements, such as walking, running, or jumping, to create a more immersive experience.





Develop a realistic body camera system for R15 character models, where the player's perspective is simulated through a first-person viewpoint. 

Upon spawning, the camera view is blurred, with a gradual clearing effect that takes approximately 2-3 seconds to fully resolve, allowing the player to see their character's body. 

Implement a camera shake effect that mimics real-life movement, with subtle vibrations and jolts when the player walks, runs, or jumps. The camera movement should be smooth and responsive, with a slight delay to simulate human reaction time.

The camera system should only support R15 character models, with optimized performance for low-end and high-end devices. 

Ensure the camera view is properly aligned with the character's head and body, with correct occlusion and collision detection to prevent the camera from clipping through solid objects. 

Add support for various camera settings, such as field of view, sensitivity, and zoom, to allow players to customize their experience. 

The camera system should be compatible with existing R15 character animations and movements, with seamless integration into the game's core mechanics. 

Optimize the camera system for performance, with a target frame rate of 60 FPS on mid-range hardware, and ensure that it does not cause significant
