Create a realistic body camera system for R15 character models, where the camera view is initially blurred and gradually clears as the player spawns.

The camera should start with a blurred effect, simulating the player's vision adjusting to the environment, and then slowly transition to a clear view, revealing the player's character model.

Implement a camera shake effect that mimics real-life camera movement, taking into account the player's movements, such as walking, running, or jumping, to create a more immersive experience.
